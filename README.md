Read the README

## Locate Releases from the <> Code Tab

It is on the right side under but not inside of the About Section

Click on Releases

Please make sure you select the release option based on your OS, which should be either Windows or Mac

There will be options, 
    The Python one is slightly lower quaility, might have native application window shrink, but is smaller file size
    The Javascript one is higher quality, no native application window shrinking, and is around 2x larger file size then the Python.
    You do not have to download both of the options, only one 

You can choose which automated browser to use, google or microsoft edge, based on preference

You do not have to download both broswer types

## Downloading the Application
Click on the name for one of the options and your computer will download it

## Opening the Application
Download the .zip file that corresponds with the browser you choose in either the Python or Javascript releases

When it finishes downloading, you can unzip/extract the file in the downloads folder

The .exe file will be inside of the new folder created, you can move it or place it wherever you wish

You will be able to use the .exe now

## Running the Application
After you open the non-zip file and double click the .exe inside

A windows smartscreen defender window will open asking if you are sure you want to run the program

All you need to do is select the more options in the upper right area and click the run anyway that will show up

After the application will work and you can now use the falconlink automation
