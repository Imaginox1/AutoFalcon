Read the README

## Locate Releases from the <> Code Tab

It is on the right side under but not inside of the About Section

Click on Releases

Please make sure you select the release option based on your OS, which should be either Windows or Mac

There will be options, 
    The Python one is slightly lower quaility, might have native application window shrink, but is smaller file size
    The Javascript one is higher quality, no native application window shrinking, and is around 2x larger file size then the Python.
    You do not have to download both of the options, only one 

You can choose which automated browser to use, google or microsoft edge, based on preference

You do not have to download both broswer types

## Downloading the Application
Click on the name for one of the options and your computer will download it

Your computer might say it is a virus, it is not, but since I did not buy a dev lisence, there it no proof to microsoft or apple that I am making safe applications. 

Your computer will ask you if you are sure it is safe, it is safe to download

You will need go to your browsers downlaod section and select keep, and if it asks for keep again, select keep.
